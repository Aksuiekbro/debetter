# Database Connection Timeout Error Summary

**Task:** Fetching details for a specific posting (Team 7 vs Team 12) in Qamqor Cup (ID: `67f0496a8f8debcc88f45174`).

**Script:** `findSpecificPosting.js` (or similar script executed by Code mode)

**Error Encountered:**
```
MongooseError: Operation `debates.findOne()` buffering timed out after 10000ms
```

**Analysis:**
This error indicates that the Mongoose library could not establish a functional connection to the MongoDB Atlas database (`mongodb+srv://dauren190307:***@mango.oafyn.mongodb.net/debate-platform...`) within the default 10-second timeout period when trying to execute the `findOne()` operation.

**Likely Causes (as discussed):**
*   Intermittent network connectivity issues between the execution environment and MongoDB Atlas.
*   Firewall rules blocking the connection.
*   Temporary issues or high load on the Atlas cluster (`mango.oafyn.mongodb.net`).
*   Local machine resource constraints.

**Note:** This was *not* an error in the query logic itself, but a failure to connect to the database to execute the query. Solution is likely debates.findOne() instead of tournaments.findOne()
