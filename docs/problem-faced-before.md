The problem was twofold:

Backend API Issue: Initially, the backend API endpoint (GET /api/debates/:debateId/postings/:postingId) that the "Active Judging Interface" calls wasn't sending all the necessary details. It returned the basic posting info but was missing things like the theme, location, start time, and the names/details of the assigned teams and their members. We fixed the backend controller (debateController.getPostingDetails) to fetch the parent tournament document, look up the team names and members, and include all these details in the response.
Frontend Display Issue: After fixing the backend, the frontend component (ActiveJudgeInterface.js) was receiving the correct data in its state (postingDetails), but the JSX code responsible for displaying the details was trying to access them using incorrect paths (e.g., maybe postingDetails.debate.theme instead of the correct postingDetails.theme). We fixed the JSX to use the correct property names (postingDetails.theme, postingDetails.team1.name, postingDetails.team2.name, etc.) based on the actual structure of the data being received from the corrected API.
