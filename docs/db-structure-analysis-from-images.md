# Database Structure Analysis (Based on Provided Images)

This document summarizes the observed structure of the `debate-platform` MongoDB database based on the provided images.

## Database Name

- `debate-platform`

## Collections Overview

The following collections were observed, along with their document counts as shown in the images:

- `apfevaluations`: 1 document
- `debates`: 1 document
- `notifications`: 0 documents
- `teams`: 0 documents
- `tournaments`: 0 documents
- `users`: 3 documents

## Key Observations from Example Documents

- **`apfevaluations`**: An example document exists, indicating fields related to APF evaluations. (Specific fields were not detailed in the provided summary).
- **`debates`**:
    - An example document exists with `status: "completed"`.
    - This document contains embedded team information.
- **`users`**: Example documents exist, indicating fields related to user data. (Specific fields were not detailed in the provided summary).

## Notable Points & Potential Inconsistencies

- **Empty Collections**: The `notifications`, `teams`, and `tournaments` collections appear empty (0 documents) in the provided images.
- **Teams Discrepancy**: There's a potential inconsistency regarding teams. The `teams` collection is shown as empty, yet the example `debates` document contains embedded team information. This suggests teams might be primarily managed within the `debates` documents rather than as separate entities in the `teams` collection, at least for the data captured in the images.
